    "## Code Generation with Gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini is an AI-powered collaborator helping development teams build, deploy, and operate applications faster and more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will show how Gemini for Developers can be used to assist in writing new code segments, extracting code for microservice decomposition, and building an API Gateway as part of the Cymbal Superstore project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labs in this course covers a typical software development life cycle (SDLC) from the application developers point of view. Other aspects of the SDLC (requirements, security, monitoring, etc.) will be covered in other courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lab Premise**: You have recently joined a team that has developed an online shopping website called Cymbal Superstore. It is operational and you have been tasked with implementing some upgrades. Specifically adding a new endpoint service called new products. All of the existing code will be provided as part of the lab setup as well as any infrastructure services needed for the lab. The code will be in a folder called cymbal-superstore and looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/cymbal-superstore.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, you have been given the requirements from the business analyst on the team. Based on the knowledge gained previously you will add the necessary code for the new service, newproducts. After confirming the new endpoint works, you will extract it into a separate microservice implemented in cloud functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you learn how to utilize Gemini in the following ways:.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create effective code generation prompts using natural language descriptions.\n",
    "- Use in-line comments to generate and modify code.\n"

    "### Task 1. Setup the Cymbal Superstore\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab uses the \"Cymbal Superstore\" grocery web app. In subsequent tasks of this lab, you use Gemini to develop and deploy a new feature in this app. In this task, you build the frontend and backend components of this app.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configure the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the commands in this and the next two subtasks in the terminal shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Cloud Shell, run the following command to set the necessary environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)\n",
    "export USER=$(gcloud config get-value account)\n",

    "To run the Docker credential helper, run the following command. When asked if you want to continue, type **Y**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gcloud auth configure-docker\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Enable the Cloud AI Companion API:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gcloud services enable cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com --project ${PROJECT_ID}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Gemini, grant the necessary IAM roles to your Google Cloud Qwiklabs user account:\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Build the backend\n",
    "\n",
    "The web app backend implements an inventory API that is used by the frontend to fetch and update products.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the backend container image, in the cloud terminal, run the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ~/cymbal-superstore/backend\n",
    "docker build -t gcr.io/qwiklabs-gcp-00-26a66ba6373e/cymbal-superstore-inventory-api:latest .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To push the built backend image to the Cloud Repository, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker push gcr.io/qwiklabs-gcp-00-26a66ba6373e/cymbal-superstore-inventory-api:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To deploy the backend as a service on Cloud Run, run the following command. Allow unauthenticated invocations to inventory by pressing the button **Y**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "gcloud run deploy inventory --image=gcr.io/qwiklabs-gcp-00-26a66ba6373e/cymbal-superstore-inventory-api --port=8000 --region=us-central1 --project=$PROJECT_ID\n",

    "In a browser tab, execute Cloud Run Service URL (from above):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: `https://inventory-bacbqreknq-uk.a.run.app`\n",
    "\n",
    "To the base URL add the endpoint path `/products`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: `https://inventory-bacbqreknq-uk.a.run.app/products`\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the JSON Data of all the store' s products\n",
    "\n",
    "To the base URL add the endpoint path `/newproducts`. This will display an error since the newproducts endpoint has not been written.\n",

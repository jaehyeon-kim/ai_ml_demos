# Boost Productivity with Gemini in BigQuery

## Lab 1 - Explore Data with Gemini in BigQuery

[Data insights](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/data-insights) offers an automated way to explore and understand your data. With data insights, Gemini uses metadata to generate natural language questions about your table and the queries to answer them. This helps you uncover patterns, assess data quality, and perform statistical analysis.

- Run the Insights pipeline to view the recommended queries for this table. Insights quality improves when the table has a [published profile scan](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/data-profile-scan) and [table description/column descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/data-insights).

The table explorer is a tool for getting started with data exploration in BigQuery, especially if you're new to SQL or want a quick way to understand your data.

In this lab, you learn how to:

- Generate data insights on the order item table.
- Use the table explorer with the location table and generate basic queries.
- Query the order item table without SQL code.

## Lab 2 - Develop Code with Gemini in BigQuery

In this lab, you learn how to:

- Generate a SQL query using a natural language prompt.
- Use the code explanation feature of BigQuery.
- Modify SQL code with the transform feature of BigQuery.
- Prompt Gemini to review and debug SQL code in BigQuery.
- Ask Gemini for suggestions to fix a SQL code issue.

## Lab 3 - Use Data Canvas to Visualize and Design Queries

In this lab, you learn how to use Data Canvas to:

- Join the menu, orders, and order item tables.
- Calculate the total revenue for all menu items in 2024.
- Create a bar chart displaying the top 10 items by total revenue.
- Identify two menu items generating the same revenue.
- Collaborate with others.

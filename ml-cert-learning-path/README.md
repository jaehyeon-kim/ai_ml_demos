- [TensorFlow 2.0 Complete Course - Python Neural Networks for Beginners Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPYj3fFJGjk)
  - Learn how to use TensorFlow 2.0 in this full tutorial course for beginners. This course is designed for Python programmers looking to enhance their knowledge and skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
  - Some modules are outdated e.g. by using the `tf-estimator` packaged. Therefore, examples are updated whenever possible. See the [source](./tensorflow_2_complete_course) for more details.
- [TensorFlow 2.0 Beginner Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhhyoLH6IjfxVOdVC1P1L5z5azs0XjMsb)
  - Welcome to TensorFlow Tutorials with the goal to build a strong foundation, so we can start building our own projects! I have tried to make these videos very concise, to the point and focused on implementation details in TensorFlow and not on the theoretical concepts (like how do CNNs work etc.). Rather I refer you to specific video lectures (mostly by Andrew Ng) for each specific video and with the theory and understanding of the necessary concepts I then show you how to implement it in TensorFlow.
  - Only the first few sections are followed as it doesn't cover theoretical part and is not follow along. See the [source](./tensorflow_tutorials) for more details.
- [The Complete Pytorch Deep Learning Series!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN8j_qfCJpNhhY26TQpXC5VeK-_q3YLPa)
  - In this video series we journey into the realm of Deep Learning with PyTorch! We will learn how to use PyTorch to implement and explain the workings of Neural Networks, Convolutional Networks, Attention, Transformers and beyond. Get ready to master Pytorch and Deep Learning!
- [Deep Learning With PyTorch - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M)
  - In this course you learn all the fundamentals to get started with PyTorch and Deep Learning.
